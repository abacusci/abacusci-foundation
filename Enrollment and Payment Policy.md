# Enrollment and Payment Policy

This document outlines the general enrollment and payment policy for all modules and programs offered by **Abacus Computing Institute (AbacusCI)**. These rules apply at all times, regardless of the specific module, period, or target audience.

## 1. Enrollment Procedure

- Students may register their interest through:
  - The official website form.
  - Institutional email contact.
  - Announced registration channels on social media.
- Registration does **not** guarantee immediate placement in a group. Placement is based on module availability and student profile.
- Once a viable group is formed and scheduled, students will be notified to proceed with payment.

## 2. Payment Policy

- Payments are made **monthly**, per module.
- Module fees must be paid **in full** prior to the start of the course.
- Payment secures a studentâ€™s seat in a confirmed group.

## 3. Refund Policy

- Payments are **non-refundable**, except in the following cases:
  - The module is cancelled by AbacusCI.
  - The student was incorrectly placed due to an internal error.
- If a student fails to meet the expected knowledge or cannot follow the module after payment, **no refund will be issued**.
- It is the responsibility of the student (or parent/guardian) to review the module requirements beforehand.

## 4. Module Requirements

- Every module includes a public description outlining the **minimum expected knowledge or skills**.
- Students should only enroll if they meet these expectations or are willing to commit extra effort to catch up.
- AbacusCI is not responsible for academic struggles due to unpreparedness.

## 5. Group Activation and Flexibility

- Modules only begin when a group is confirmed as viable.
- Group sizes are flexible but must support effective teaching and learning.
- AbacusCI may reassign students to alternate groups based on interest, age, or course availability.

## 6. Final Exam and Certification

- Each module ends with a mandatory onsite final exam.
- Only students who pass this exam will receive a certificate of completion.
- Failure to attend or pass the exam results in no certification, regardless of attendance or effort.

## 7. Policy Revisions

- AbacusCI reserves the right to revise these policies at any time.
- All updates will be posted in official communication channels and apply immediately unless stated otherwise.
